# Translations <sup class="vt-badge wip" />

The Vue documentation has recently undergone a major revision, so there are no completed translations in other languages yet.

Translation efforts are managed in the [vuejs-translations](https://github.com/vuejs-translations/) GitHub organization. There are currently the following translations underway. If you want to contribute, you can open an issue to express your interest.

- [Simplified Chinese](https://github.com/vuejs-translations/docs-zh-cn)
- [Japanese](https://github.com/vuejs-translations/docs-ja)

## Starting a new Translation

We are hoping to establish a standard workflow for community translations so that we can more easily coordinate community efforts. Please keep an eye on the [Translation Guidelines repo](https://github.com/vuejs-translations/guidelines/blob/main/README.md) for updates.

In the meanwhile, if you are interested in starting translation for a new language, please open a thread in the [Discussions](https://github.com/vuejs-translations/guidelines/discussions) (and check if there is already one created for your language). This can help you find fellow collaborators and avoid duplicated efforts.
