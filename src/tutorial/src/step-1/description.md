# Getting Started

Welcome to the Vue tutorial!

The goal of this tutorial is to quickly give you an experience of what it feels like to work with Vue, right in the browser. It does **not** aim to be comprehensive, so after you complete it, make sure to also read the <a target="_blank" href="/guide/introduction.html">Guide</a> which covers each topic in more details.

Vue offers two API styles: Options API and Composition API. This tutorial is designed to work for both - you can choose your preferred style using the **API Preference** switches at the top. <a target="_blank" href="/guide/introduction.html#api-styles">Learn more about API styles</a>.

You can also switch between SFC-mode or HTML-mode. The former will show code examples in <a target="_blank" href="/guide/introduction.html#single-file-components">Single-File Component</a> (SFC) format, which is what most developers use when they use Vue with a build step. HTML-mode shows usage without a build step.

You can edit the code <span class="wide">on the right</span><span class="narrow">below</span> and see the result update instantly. Each step will introduce a core feature of Vue, and you will be expected to complete the code to get the demo working. If you get stuck, you will have a "Show me!" button that reveals the working code for you. Try not to rely on it too much - you'll learn faster by figuring things out on your own.
