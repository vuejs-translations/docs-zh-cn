# Declarative Rendering

<div class="sfc">

What you see in the editor is a Vue Single File Component (SFC). An SFC is a reusable self-contained block of code that encapsulates HTML, CSS and JavaScript that belong together, written inside a `.vue` file.

</div>

The core feature of Vue is **declarative rendering**: using a template syntax that extends HTML, we can describe how the HTML should look like based on JavaScript state. When the state changes, the HTML updates automatically.

<div class="composition-api">

State that can trigger updates when changed are considered **reactive**. We can declare reactive state using Vue's `reactive()` API. Objects created from `reactive()` are JavaScript [Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) that work just like normal objects:

```js
import { reactive } from 'vue'

const counter = reactive({
  count: 1
})

console.log(counter.count) // 0
counter.count++
```

`reactive()` only works on objects (including arrays and built-in types like `Map` and `Set`). `ref()`, on the other hand, can take any value type and create an object that exposes the inner value under a `.value` property:

```js
import { ref } from 'vue'

const message = ref('Hello World!')

console.log(message.value) // "Hello World!"
message.value = 'Changed'
```

Details on `reactive()` and `ref()` are discussed in <a target="_blank" href="/guide/essentials/reactivity-fundamentals.html">Guide - Reactivity Fundamentals</a>.

<div class="sfc">

Reactive state declared in the component's `<script setup>` block can be used directly in the template. This is how we can render dynamic text based on the value of the `counter` object and `message` ref, using mustaches syntax:

</div>

<div class="html">

The object being passed to `createApp()` is a Vue component. A component's state should be declared inside its `setup()` function, and returned using an object:

```js{2,5}
setup() {
  const counter = reactive({ count: 0 })
  const message = ref('Hello World!')
  return {
    counter,
    message
  }
}
```

Properties in the returned object will be made available in the template. This is how we can render dynamic text based on the value of `message`, using mustaches syntax:

</div>

```vue-html
<h1>{{ message }}</h1>
<p>count is: {{ counter.count }}</p>
```

Notice how we did not need to use `.value` when accessing the `message` ref in templates: it is automatically unwrapped for more succinct usage.

</div>

<div class="options-api">

State that can trigger updates when changed are considered **reactive**. In Vue, reactive state is held in components. In the example code, the object being passed to `createApp()` is a component.

We can declare reactive state using the `data` component option, which should be a function that returns an object:

<div class="sfc">

```js{3-5}
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      message: 'Hello World!'
    }
  }
}
```

</div>
<div class="html">

```js{3-5}
createApp({
  data() {
    return {
      message: 'Hello World!'
    }
  }
})
```

</div>

The `message` property will be made available in the template. This is how we can render dynamic text based on the value of `message`, using mustaches syntax:

```vue-html
<h1>{{ message }}</h1>
```

</div>

The content inside the mustaches is not limited to just identifiers or paths - we can use any valid JavaScript expression:

```vue-html
<h1>{{ message.split('').reverse().join('') }}</h1>
```

<div class="composition-api">

Now, try to create some reactive state yourself, and use it to render dynamic text content for the `<h1>` in the template.

</div>

<div class="options-api">

Now, try to create a data property yourself, and use it as the text content for the `<h1>` in the template.

</div>
