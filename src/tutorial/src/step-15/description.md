# You Did It!

You have finished the tutorial!

At this point, you should have a good idea of what it's like to work with Vue. However, we covered a lot of things really fast and glossed over the details, so definitely keep learning! As a next step, you can:

- Set up a real Vue project on your machine by following the [Quick Start](/guide/quick-start.html).

- Go through the [Main Guide](/guide/essentials/application.html), which covers all the topics we learned so far in greater details, and much more.

- Check out some more practical [Examples](/examples/).

We can't wait to see what you build next!
