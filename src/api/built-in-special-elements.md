# Built-in Special Elements

:::info Not Components
`<component>` and `<slot>` are component-like features and part of the template syntax. They are not true components and are compiled away during template compilation. As such, they are conventionally written with lowercase in templates.

## `<component>`

A "meta component" for rendering dynamic components or elements.

- **Props**

  ```ts
  interface DynamicComponentProps {
    is: string | Component
  }
  ```

- **详细信息**

  The actual component to render is determined by the `is` prop.

  - When `is` is a string, it could be either an HTML tag name or a component's registered name.

  - Alternatively, `is` can also be directly bound to the definition of a component.

- **示例**

  Rendering components by registered name (Options API):

  ```vue
  <script>
  import Foo from './Foo.vue'
  import Bar from './Bar.vue'

  export default {
    components: { Foo, Bar },
    data() {
      return {
        view: 'Foo'
      }
    }
  }
  </script>

  <template>
    <component :is="view" />
  </template>
  ```

  Rendering components by definition (Composition API with `<script setup>`):

  ```vue
  <script setup>
  import Foo from './Foo.vue'
  import Bar from './Bar.vue'
  </script>

  <template>
    <component :is="Math.random() > 0.5 ? Foo : Bar" />
  </template>
  ```

  Rendering HTML elements:

  ```vue-html
  <component :is="href ? 'a' : 'span'"></component>
  ```

  The [built-in components](./built-in-components.html) can all be passed to `is`, but you must register them if you want to pass them by name. For example:

  ```vue
  <script>
  import { Transition, TransitionGroup } from 'vue'

  export default {
    components: {
      Transition,
      TransitionGroup
    }
  }
  </script>

  <template>
    <component :is="isGroup ? 'TransitionGroup' : 'Transition'">
      ...
    </component>
  </template>
  ```

  Registration is not required if you pass the component itself to `is` rather than its name, e.g. in `<script setup>`.

## `<slot>`

Denotes slot content outlets in templates.

- **Props**

  ```ts
  interface SlotProps {
    /**
     * Any props passed to <slot> to passed as arguments
     * for scoped slots
     */
    [key: string]: any
    /**
     * Reserved for specifying slot name.
     */
    name?: string
  }
  ```

- **详细信息**

  The `<slot>` element can use the `name` attribute to specify a slot name. When no `name` is specified, it will render the default slot. Additional attributes passed to the slot element will be passed as slot props to the scoped slot defined in the parent.

  The element itself will be replaced by its matched slot content.

  `<slot>` elements in Vue templates are compiled into JavaScript, so they are not to be confused with [native `<slot>` elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/slot).
