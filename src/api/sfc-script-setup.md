# \<script setup>

`<script setup>` is a compile-time syntactic sugar for using Composition API inside Single File Components (SFCs). It is the recommended syntax if you are using both SFCs and Composition API. It provides a number of advantages over the normal `<script>` syntax:

- More succinct code with less boilerplate
- Ability to declare props and emitted events using pure TypeScript
- Better runtime performance (the template is compiled into a render function in the same scope, without an intermediate proxy)
- Better IDE type-inference performance (less work for the language server to extract types from code)

## Basic Syntax

To opt-in to the syntax, add the `setup` attribute to the `<script>` block:

```vue
<script setup>
console.log('hello script setup')
</script>
```

The code inside is compiled as the content of the component's `setup()` function. This means that unlike normal `<script>`, which only executes once when the component is first imported, code inside `<script setup>` will **execute every time an instance of the component is created**.

### Top-level bindings are exposed to template

When using `<script setup>`, any top-level bindings (including variables, function declarations, and imports) declared inside `<script setup>` are directly usable in the template:

```vue
<script setup>
// variable
const msg = 'Hello!'

// functions
function log() {
  console.log(msg)
}
</script>

<template>
  <div @click="log">{{ msg }}</div>
</template>
```

Imports are exposed in the same fashion. This means you can directly use an imported helper function in template expressions without having to expose it via the `methods` option:

```vue
<script setup>
import { capitalize } from './helpers'
</script>

<template>
  <div>{{ capitalize('hello') }}</div>
</template>
```

## Reactivity

Reactive state needs to be explicitly created using [Reactivity APIs](./reactivity-core.html). Similar to values returned from a `setup()` function, refs are automatically unwrapped when referenced in templates:

```vue
<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue'

const count = ref(0)
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="count++">{{ count }}</button>
</template>
```

## Using Components

Values in the scope of `<script setup>` can also be used directly as custom component tag names:

```vue
<script setup>
import MyComponent from './MyComponent.vue'
</script>

<template>
  <MyComponent />
</template>
```

Think of `MyComponent` as being referenced as a variable. If you have used JSX, the mental model is similar here. The kebab-case equivalent `<my-component>` also works in the template - however PascalCase component tags are strongly recommended for consistency. It also helps differentiating from native custom elements.

### Dynamic Components

Since components are referenced as variables instead of registered under string keys, we should use dynamic `:is` binding when using dynamic components inside `<script setup>`:

```vue
<script setup>
import Foo from './Foo.vue'
import Bar from './Bar.vue'
</script>

<template>
  <component :is="Foo" />
  <component :is="someCondition ? Foo : Bar" />
</template>
```

Note how the components can be used as variables in a ternary expression.

### Recursive Components

An SFC can implicitly refer to itself via its filename. E.g. a file named `FooBar.vue` can refer to itself as `<FooBar/>` in its template.

Note this has lower priority than imported components. If you have a named import that conflicts with the component's inferred name, you can alias the import:

```js
import { FooBar as FooBarChild } from './components'
```

### Namespaced Components

You can use component tags with dots like `<Foo.Bar>` to refer to components nested under object properties. This is useful when you import multiple components from a single file:

```vue
<script setup>
import * as Form from './form-components'
</script>

<template>
  <Form.Input>
    <Form.Label>label</Form.Label>
  </Form.Input>
</template>
```

## Using Custom Directives

Globally registered custom directives just work as normal. Local custom directives don't need to be explicitly registered with `<script setup>`, but they must follow the naming scheme `vNameOfDirective`:

```vue
<script setup>
const vMyDirective = {
  beforeMount: (el) => {
    // do something with the element
  }
}
</script>
<template>
  <h1 v-my-directive>This is a Heading</h1>
</template>
```

If you're importing a directive from elsewhere, it can be renamed to fit the required naming scheme:

```vue
<script setup>
import { myDirective as vMyDirective } from './MyDirective.js'
</script>
```

## defineProps() & defineEmits()

To declare options like `props` and `emits` with full type inference support, we can use the `defineProps` and `defineEmits` APIs, which are automatically available inside `<script setup>`:

```vue
<script setup>
const props = defineProps({
  foo: String
})

const emit = defineEmits(['change', 'delete'])
// setup code
</script>
```

- `defineProps` and `defineEmits` are **compiler macros** only usable inside `<script setup>`. They do not need to be imported, and are compiled away when `<script setup>` is processed.

- `defineProps` accepts the same value as the `props` option, while `defineEmits` accepts the same value as the `emits` option.

- `defineProps` and `defineEmits` provide proper type inference based on the options passed.

- The options passed to `defineProps` and `defineEmits` will be hoisted out of setup into module scope. Therefore, the options cannot reference local variables declared in setup scope. Doing so will result in a compile error. However, it _can_ reference imported bindings since they are in the module scope as well.

If you are using TypeScript, it is also possible to [declare props and emits using pure type annotations](#typescript-only-features).

## defineExpose()

Components using `<script setup>` are **closed by default** - i.e. the public instance of the component, which is retrieved via template refs or `$parent` chains, will **not** expose any of the bindings declared inside `<script setup>`.

To explicitly expose properties in a `<script setup>` component, use the `defineExpose` compiler macro:

```vue
<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue'

const a = 1
const b = ref(2)

defineExpose({
  a,
  b
})
</script>
```

When a parent gets an instance of this component via template refs, the retrieved instance will be of the shape `{ a: number, b: number }` (refs are automatically unwrapped just like on normal instances).

## `useSlots()` & `useAttrs()`

Usage of `slots` and `attrs` inside `<script setup>` should be relatively rare, since you can access them directly as `$slots` and `$attrs` in the template. In the rare case where you do need them, use the `useSlots` and `useAttrs` helpers respectively:

```vue
<script setup>
import { useSlots, useAttrs } from 'vue'

const slots = useSlots()
const attrs = useAttrs()
</script>
```

`useSlots` and `useAttrs` are actual runtime functions that return the equivalent of `setupContext.slots` and `setupContext.attrs`. They can be used in normal composition API functions as well.

## Usage alongside normal `<script>`

`<script setup>` can be used alongside normal `<script>`. A normal `<script>` may be needed in cases where we need to:

- Declare options that cannot be expressed in `<script setup>`, for example `inheritAttrs` or custom options enabled via plugins.
- Declaring named exports.
- Run side effects or create objects that should only execute once.

```vue
<script>
// normal <script>, executed in module scope (only once)
runSideEffectOnce()

// declare additional options
export default {
  inheritAttrs: false,
  customOptions: {}
}
</script>

<script setup>
// executed in setup() scope (for each instance)
</script>
```

## Top-level `await`

Top-level `await` can be used inside `<script setup>`. The resulting code will be compiled as `async setup()`:

```vue
<script setup>
const post = await fetch(`/api/post/1`).then((r) => r.json())
</script>
```

In addition, the awaited expression will be automatically compiled in a format that preserves the current component instance context after the `await`.

:::warning Note
`async setup()` must be used in combination with `Suspense`, which is currently still an experimental feature. We plan to finalize and document it in a future release - but if you are curious now, you can refer to its [tests](https://github.com/vuejs/core/blob/main/packages/runtime-core/__tests__/components/Suspense.spec.ts) to see how it works.

### Type-only props/emit declarations

Props and emits can also be declared using pure-type syntax by passing a literal type argument to `defineProps` or `defineEmits`:

```ts
const props = defineProps<{
  foo: string
  bar?: number
}>()

const emit = defineEmits<{
  (e: 'change', id: number): void
  (e: 'update', value: string): void
}>()
```

- `defineProps` or `defineEmits` can only use either runtime declaration OR type declaration. Using both at the same time will result in a compile error.

- When using type declaration, the equivalent runtime declaration is automatically generated from static analysis to remove the need for double declaration and still ensure correct runtime behavior.

  - In dev mode, the compiler will try to infer corresponding runtime validation from the types. For example here `foo: String` is inferred from the `foo: string` type. If the type is a reference to an imported type, the inferred result will be `foo: null` (equal to `any` type) since the compiler does not have information of external files.

  - In prod mode, the compiler will generate the array format declaration to reduce bundle size (the props here will be compiled into `['foo', 'bar']`)

  - The emitted code is still TypeScript with valid typing, which can be further processed by other tools.

- As of now, the type declaration argument must be one of the following to ensure correct static analysis:

  - A type literal
  - A reference to an interface or a type literal in the same file

  Currently complex types and type imports from other files are not supported. It is possible to support type imports in the future.

### Default props values when using type declaration

One drawback of the type-only `defineProps` declaration is that it doesn't have a way to provide default values for the props. To resolve this problem, a `withDefaults` compiler macro is also provided:

```ts
interface Props {
  msg?: string
  labels?: string[]
}

const props = withDefaults(defineProps<Props>(), {
  msg: 'hello',
  labels: () => ['one', 'two']
})
```

This will be compiled to equivalent runtime props `default` options. In addition, the `withDefaults` helper provides type checks for the default values, and ensures the returned `props` type has the optional flags removed for properties that do have default values declared.

## Restrictions

Due to the difference in module execution semantics, code inside `<script setup>` relies on the context of an SFC. When moved into external `.js` or `.ts` files, it may lead to confusion for both developers and tools. Therefore, **`<script setup>`** cannot be used with the `src` attribute.
